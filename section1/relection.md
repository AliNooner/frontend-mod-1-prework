## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I have always had a growth mindset and I think that will help me a lot during my time at Turing. I believe anyone is capable of learning a new skill, as long as the dedication is there. I have felt the most confident at this point when I was showing my dad what I've learned so far and walking him through it, and he was understanding what I was saying. I've also believed that one true way to tell if you've learned something is to be able to teach it to another person. I am going to work on taking breaks early and often, as I can easily get consumed in what I'm working on and lose track of time. By the time I realize how long I've been working on something, I am mentally exhausted. I think these short breaks will help tremendously with taking in and processing all of the new information I'll be learning. Also, I would like to improve on taking care of my brain. Maybe keep things like blueberries around as a snack - reach for a handful instead of going straight for the Red Bull.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
