## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I would say I am a solid mix. Sometimes I will ask a question as I'm still looking at my notes and processing information. One of my fears with asking questions is by the time I get the question out of my mouth, the conversation will have moved on. But if I'm working on a project myself, I would say I wait the right amount of time, or possible wait a little too long. I love figuring things out myself.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

It felt good to really have to figure out a lot of things on my own. It is such a cool feeling when you are working hard to figure something out and it finally clicks. I'm feeling a lot more comfortable with running a file in node and understanding what kind of output I'm looking for. Parts of Section 2 were uncomfortable because I have basically zero background in coding and I am a big advocate of asking questions when you are lost, which I didn't while completing this section. I think removing some of the support from this section helped me understand that although it make take a lot longer than what I'm used to, I can figure out the answers on my own and be successful. It's a great feeling!

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is used for checking a specific condition and executing the code based on the specified condition. A conditional statement uses if, else if and else. A daily life example would be what I have to drink with breakfast. If I have coffee, I will have coffee. If I don't have coffee, I will have tea. If I don't have coffee or tea, I will have orange juice.

4.  How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You would add `else if` statements. The program will read the `if` statement. If the `if` statement is true, it will stop there. If the `if` statement is false, it will continue to the first `else if` statement. If that `else if` statement is also false, it will move on to the next `else if` statement. It will repeat this process until it determines if any of the `else if` statements are true. If none of the `else if` statements are true, it will return whatever is associated with the `else` statement, essentially meaning any other option, and will stop there.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

We can use a logical operator.
- && (AND logical operator)  
- || (OR logical operator)

(Node also came to mind as a way of checking the conditions are met, but that is in a different realm)

* What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

Does every `if` statement need an `else` statement?
For example, when we are dealing exclusively with numeric datatypes and variables.
In the dogAge exercise, one of the `else if` statements was > 10, which would be all numbers greater than 10. Does this example need an `else` statement, or would it be covered by the `else if` >10 statement?
