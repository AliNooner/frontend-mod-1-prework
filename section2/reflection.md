## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

- I would say I am a solid mix. Sometimes I will ask a question as I'm still looking at my notes and processing information. One of my fears with asking questions is by the time I get the question out of my mouth, the conversation will have moved on. But if I'm working on a project myself, I would say I wait the right amount of time, or possible wait a little too long. I love figuring things out myself.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
