## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

The part about how making mistakes is essential to learning definitely resonated with me. Replit is one of my new best friends. It makes trying out code and changing things within it much less intimidating. I love that you can run the code and it often will give you hints about what the problem may be. I quickly learned that the code may be right, I may understand a concept, but I missed something small like a "+" which throws the entire code off. I like the idea of striving to improve within one's Zone of Proximal Development (ZDP). This early on in the Turing program, it is difficult for me to imagine exactly what a day in the life will mean for me in my future positions. It really got me thinking about how I will be focused on things that I know very well, but also challenged to learn more, which is always my goal. Also, I really like the idea of S.M.A.R.T. goals. Although Turing is intense, it's great because the things I will be learning and my goals are really broken down into S.M.A.R.T. goals, which makes them seem achievable!

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I am a huge believer that you are able to learn anything you want to through being disciplined, practicing and persevering in the face of difficulty, and repeat. I am big on creating S.M.A.R.T. goals and believing in my potential and the potential of others. I need to remember to keep my growth mindset when I get stuck on a problem, and get used to the fact that figuring some of these things out might just take a little extra time. And not get frustrated :]

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I think Door Dash is a great example of a mobile application that uses arrays. Each restaurant lists each category of food they offer, and each food category has a separate list of food items within it.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array is able to hold many different values (of the same data type) at the same time. An array stores a collection of data.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop allows us to repeat a code (or an action) as many times as we want, without having to manually enter the code (or action). We would use a loop in conjunction with an array if we wanted to, for example, create a list and/or edit a list. We would use a loop without an array to for example, list a set of numbers or add numbers.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

I would say "what if you wanted to print out a note to hang on your fridge that says "I love my dog" one hundred times?" Instead of typing it out one thousand times, a loop lets you type it one time and it will write "I love my dog" for you one hundred times!

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I have SO MANY. I understand the basic methods we've learned so far in this section, but I can only imagine the other (much more involved) ways we are able to use loops and arrays. I am just excited to see how they are both used in the real world when creating a webpage or an app. Thank you!
