## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
The Pomodoro technique is very helpful. At first it was a little stressful almost when my alarm went off, reminding me to take the necessary breaks. Once I got used to it, it got a lot easier.


2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I found the Pomodoro technique works for me some days, and not others. Sometimes it served as a great reminder to get up and move and take these breaks, but it was distracting on some days. I found it difficult to come back to a train of thought I was having when I was working on a difficult problem. Also, my dogs would sometimes get up and get crazy when I took my breaks because they thought it was play time. Overall, I would say it was pretty helpful with keeping my stress levels down.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object is used to store and organize complex data. It is different than an Array in that an Array is able to store an ordered list of information which is accessed by an index, while an Object can hold strings of information that can be accessed separately. Objects are more complex and can contain functions.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  - An Array, if we just wanted their names.
  - An Object would be helpful if we wanted to store more information about each student (ie; their ages, location, etc.)
  * List of states and their capitals
  - An Array because we are only storing an ordered list of names and no other information.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  - An Array because it is an ordered list of items.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  - An Array because it is an ordered list of items.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  - An Object because we want to store each student's name and their cohort, which is more complex than only an ordered list of names.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  - An Object because we want to store each ingredient and the amount needed to bake a cake, which is more complex than only an ordered list of ingredients.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  - An Array because it will be an ordered list of names of restaurants. If we wanted to also include their location, we would want to use an Object.

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

One example that comes to mind is Journeys.com. Each time a pair of shoes is purchased, somewhere on the website, it will have to deduct one pair of shoes from their "stock" to account for one less pair of that specific shoe being available to sell.   

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
I am very interested in learning more about the functions we are able to use and how they are used in real life examples. I am excited to learn how to make them more dynamic!
